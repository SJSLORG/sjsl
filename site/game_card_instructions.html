  <h2>Game Card Instructions</h2>
  <p>To All Referees:</p>

  <p>All Game Day Rosters must be submitted electronically. The scan must be in pdf format only. Other formats are not able to be downloaded and saved efficiently. Please make an attempt to scan all GDRs within a few days following the date of the game. Grievance representatives that handle the various age groups have their emails listed on all reports. Of course, all collected player and coaches passes should be mailed promptly and accordingly.</p> 
  
  <p>When emailing, please name the pdf the following way ie. "U14 Moorestown United 2005 vs Marlton Clash 2005".  Please give the full team name to make it easier to file and locate later.  By scanning and naming the files this way, you will be greatly assisting us to record and track all violations, grievance issues and resolve any disputes in a much more timely and efficient manner.</p>
   
  <p>Thanks again for all your effort and have a great Season!</p>
  
  <p>Ed Eichen <br>
  Grievance Chairperson</p>
