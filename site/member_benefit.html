    <p>South Jersey Soccer League (SJSL) is proud to announce a partnership with both Kwik-Goal and The Soccer Post-Eatontown that will extend a discount to ALL of our member clubs and their teams.  Kwik-Goal, through Soccer Post-Eatontown, will offer a 25% discount on ALL Kwik-Goal products.</p>
    <p>Through this partnership, our member clubs can take advantage of special pricing as we prepare for the upcoming Spring 2021 soccer season.  With the pandemic, many of our clubs and teams are experiencing some challenges that are leading us to look for savings.</p>  
    <p>Looking to replace nets, fix/replace goals, need corner flags or purchase new training equipment for your club, or maybe you are a coach/trainer looking to purchase either training or coaches equipment, this opportunity will help you save valuable money in doing so. If you are a referee, they also have a line of items available for you too.</p>
