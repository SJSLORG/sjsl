    <h2>Coaching Education</h2>
    <p>To coach a team playing in SJSL, all head and assistant coaches must hold a coaching license or coaching certificate. SJSL has developed a Level 1 certification course for new coaches and a Level 2 course for coaching seeking more coaching instruction. The two courses are described below. For the Fall 2020 season, SJSL prefers the Level 1 course, but will recognize the NJ state certificate (only if obtained prior to 12/31/2019) or the USSF national licenses accompanied by the Rutgers Safety course certificate. The league does not accept the Grassroots licenses. ALL coaches must complete the Google form indicating that they hold a valid coaching license, and a copy of the license MUST be uploaded to coach in either league.</p>
    <h3>Level 1</h3>
    <p>The Level 1 course is intended for NEW coaches who do not currently hold a coaching certificate or license from another entity. It is also a good course for coaches who hold an F or higher license, and who are now looking to refresh and update their coaching knowledge. The league certification is designed to address league rules and procedures, inform coaches of the Laws of the Game, provide technical instruction and satisfy the NJ Little League Law. The schedule is posted below and will be updated periodically. The active schedule will be available through the website link. Applicants must sign up for both a classroom component AND a field component. You must attend the classroom component PRIOR to attending a field session.</p>
    <p>Applicants must be at least 16 years of age to attend the course. Applicants under the age of 18 must be accompanied by an adult at the field session, or submit the medical release and waiver form below. As a benefit to our member clubs, there is only a fee of $20, payable by check made payable to "SJSL" (regardless if you are coaching in SJSL or SJGSL). Checks should be mailed to the address as directed on the registration form.</p>
    <p>A copy of the classroom powerpoint is posted below. For the field session, applicants are encouraged to wear comfortable playing attire, soccer cleats or appropriate footwear, shinguards, and bring a size 5 soccer ball, snacks and plenty to drink. Coaches are not required to participate, but are encouraged to do so to fully experience the training provided. All coaches must submit the waiver form below. You can register

    <h3>Level 2</h3>
    <p>At the request of our membership, this course was designed to help coaches learn how to "coach" and to design and run a practice. It will discuss player development, practice design, basic attacking and defending principles, and coaching techniques. This course is intended as a followup to the Level 1 course, but it is open to any applicant that currently hold the SJ Soccer League Level 1 certificate or the NJ State certificate (formerly the F license dated prior to 12/31/19), the State E license, or the USSF National F or higher license. Applicants holding the Grassroots licenses are encouraged to take the SJ Soccer Leagues Level 1 course prior to taking the Level 2 course. </p>
    <p>All applicants must have already properly uploaded a copy of their coaching certificate/license through the appropriate league website. Note: This course does not satisfy the NJ Little League law for limited immunity. Applicants must have already taken a course that satisfies that requirement to coach in the SJSL and SJGSL travel leagues.</p>
    <p>The cost to attend the Level 2 course is $30, payable by check made out to "SJSL" (regardless if you are coaching in SJSL or SJGSL), and mailed to the address as indicated on the registration form. Cash cannot be accepted, and payment is nonrefundable. Because of the nature of the training, class sizes are capped at 20 coaches per field session. Additional classes may be scheduled depending on demand.</p>
    <p>ALL applicants will be required to participate in the coach demo session where you will be afforded an opportunity to observe other coaches demonstrating drills/activities. ALL coaches will be assigned a topic for which you will design and run a 5-7 minute drill/activity with players and receive constructive feedback. All coaches must submit the waiver form below.</p>
    <p>There is both a classroom AND a field session component to this course. You must complete BOTH components to receive your Level 2 Coaching Certificate. You must attend a classroom session PRIOR to attending a field session! There are no session waivers. Applicants must be at least 16 years of age to attend the course. Applicants under the age of 18 must be accompanied by an adult at the field session or submit the medical release and waiver form below. You can register
