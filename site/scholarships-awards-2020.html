        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pietro Del Re:</span>The College of New Jersey, Electrical Engineering </p>
        <p>Hello, my name is Pietro Del Re and I want to thank you for awarding me the South Jersey Soccer League
          Scholarship. I am a senior at Camden Catholic High School and I graduate in June. I have had the pleasure of
          making Honors this past third quarter at Camden Catholic.</p>
        <p> I have been accepted to The College of New Jersey (TCNJ) where I will be pursuing a degree in Electrical
          Engineering this fall.</p>
        <p>It is a pleasure and an honor to receive the South Jersey Soccer League Scholarship. I have been a part of
          SJSL since I was eight years old. While playing travel soccer, I have made many friends and some of which I
          still play with.</p>
        <p>I played on the Camden Catholic soccer team all four years and finished up my last season this past fall. It
          was a great experience which I will never forget.</p>
        <p>This past fall and winter, I volunteered as a “Buddy” in the Sports Unity Program (SUP) for soccer and
          basketball. SUP is a program that is dedicated to providing the opportunity for special needs children to
          learn how to play and participate in organized sports. I have volunteered in the SUP spring and fall soccer
          programs and the winter basketball program since I was in 7th grade. The Sports Unity Program has been a very
          important experience in my life and it is awesome to watch the children learn and have fun. </p>
        <p>During this tough time, I have been attending online classes for Camden Catholic to finish out the rest of
          the senior school year.</p>
        <p>I look forward to attending TCNJ in the fall where I hope to make new friends and continue to play soccer.
        </p>
        <p>I thank you again for providing me with the scholarship and I wish the South Jersey Soccer League continued
          success.</p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stephan Boyle:</span>Albright College, Undecided Major</p>
        <p>My Name is Stephan Boyle. I am currently a senior at Woodbury Junior Senior High School. In the fall of 2020
          I will be attending Albright College in Reading, Pennsylvania. As of now I’m going in as an undecided major.
          While I am there, I’m going to be a part of the men’s soccer team. I’ve played for two great SJSL clubs
          (Woodbury and Penns Grove) with two amazing coaches (Scott Magill and Matt Murray) that taught me more than
          just soccer. While I was a SJSL player, I had the chance to take what I learned and play in the EDP league for
          Deptford Premier under Luke Tyler. Currently, I am a US youth soccer referee. </p>
        <p>After college I plan on staying involved in the league and the game. During high school, I worked hard to
          maintain a 3.8 GPA. Along with that I am also a member of the National Honor Society, Math League, Student
          Council, and the Ecology Club. I also was a 4-year varsity starter for the Thundering Herd Boys Soccer Team.
          My sophomore and junior year I led the team in assists. I was also awarded the Coach’s Award my sophomore
          year. I was then named captain of the team my junior and senior year.</p>
