Please check with your club for club specific instructions.  Full instructions for these steps can be found at https://www.usclubsoccer.org/staff-registration. </p>
     
    <h4>1.         PURCHASE MEMBERSHIP</h4>
    
    <p>This step is usually completed by the club/organization’s registrar on behalf of the individual being registered.</p>
    
    <p>For the 2020-21 Governing Season:</p>
    
    <p>·         In US Club Soccer's new National Registration System (NRS) powered by SportsEngine, purchase a Staff - Competitive/Super Rec membership (instructions) for the individual(s) you are registering.</p>
    
    <p>·         Upon purchase, an email will be automatically sent to the individual being registered with unique API links to easily complete any outstanding membership eligibility requirements. These links are also accessible via the user's SportsEngine dashboard.</p>
    
    <h4>2.         Background Screening</h4>
    
    <p>For the 2020-21 Governing Season:</p>
    
    <p>·         The person for whom a membership is purchased will receive a custom email ~24 hours later with links to complete any outstanding membership eligibility requirements. The links will also be available via the SportsEngine User Profile, or you may complete the background screening application directly via this link. Complete the background screening application via that link, and the result will automatically be reflected within your membership eligibility status in the NRS.</p>
    
    <p>Timeframe: The application must be completed no earlier than six months prior to your membership purchase. A "passed" status will validate your background screening membership eligibility credential for two Governing Seasons (the one in which you are registering, and the next).</p>
    
    <p>Cost / Payment:  $18 per application, payable 1) by the person completing the application, or 2) clubs/leagues may cover the cost for their members by purchasing prepaid codes.</p>
    
    <p>Purchase prepaid codes (for registrars):  Submit the Background Screening Prepaid Code Request Form. Once the unique, one-time-use codes are emailed to you, distribute them to your coaches/staff members to apply when completing the background screening application. Unused prepaid codes issued prior to April 26, 2019 are no longer valid. Affected clubs were emailed replacement prepaid codes. If you have questions, email prepaidcodes@usclubsoccer.org.</p>
    
    <p>Other:  Click here for instructions to add or replace SafeSport or Sideline Sports Doc certificates in your background screening application after submission.</p>
    
    <h4>3.         SafeSport Training</h4>
    
    <p>The U.S. Center for SafeSport Core online training covers the following subjects: sexual abuse, hazing, bullying, emotional misconduct, physical misconduct, harassment (non-sexual) and reporting obligations. Completion takes ~90 minutes, and you may save your progress and pick up where you left off at a later time.</p>
    
    <p>For the 2020-21 Governing Season:</p>
    
    <p>·         Access the course via the unique link in the "outstanding membership eligibility requirements" email you will receive once a membership is purchased on your behalf. That link will also be available via your SportsEngine User Profile. Completion will automatically be reflected within your membership eligibility status in the NRS.</p>
    
    <p>·         You may continue a partially completed training by accessing the same link.</p>
    
    <p>·         If you already completed Core or Refresher Training via any method other than the unique link in the "outstanding membership requirements" email or your SportsEngine User Profile (ex: for U.S. Soccer or another org), upload your certificate into your background screening application for manual verification by US Club Soccer.</p>
    
    <p>Cost / Payment:  Free.</p>
    
    <h4>4.         Sideline Sports Doc (SSD) training</h4>

    <p>·         If you completed the course within the last 6 months via any method other than the unique link in the "outstanding membership requirements" email or your SportsEngine User Profile, upload your certificate (example image) into your background screening application for manual verification by US Club Soccer.</p>
    
    <p>Timeframe:  The course must be completed within six months of the date of your membership purchase or background screening application. Completion will validate your SSD membership eligibility credential for two Governing Seasons (the one in which you are registering, and the next).</p>
    
    <p>Cost and payment:  $5 per person, payable 1) by the person taking the course, or 2) clubs/leagues may cover the cost for their members by purchasing bulk access codes.</p>
