    <h2>Score Entry</h2>
    <p>Game scores are not entered from within the individual GotSoccer team account.  Instead this information is entered from the main GotSoccer website.  First, you will need to know the Event ID, Pin number, and Game number.  This information can all be found on the Game Card for the match.  It will be listed at the top right of the Game Card. </p>
    <p>Start by going to GotSoccer.com and clicking on <b>User Login</b> in the top right corner.</p>
    <p>In the bottom right of the Member Account Login area you will see a section labeled <b>Event Scheduling/Scoring</b>.  Under this header you will see a link for Scoring Input</p>
    <p>Click this link to be taken to the Scoring Input area.  Enter your Event ID and Pin Number and hit Go.  The next screen will ask for the Game Number, which can also be located on the game card.  You will now be able to enter the game scores for your match</p>
