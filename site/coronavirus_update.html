  <h2>Coronavirus Update</h2>
  <h3>August 24th, 2020</h3>
  <h4>Dear Members,</h4>
  <p>Click <a href="https://nj.gov/health/cd/documents/topics/NCOV/COVID_GuidanceForSportsActivities.pdf">"HERE"</a> for the NJ Department of Health guidelines for youth sports.</p>
<p>SJSL is currently monitoring information released by<a href="https://www.usclubsoccer.org/coronavirus">US Club Soccer</a>, <a href="https://www.ussoccer.com/">US Soccer</a>, <a href="https://www.fifa.com/who-we-are/news/five-steps-to-kicking-out-coronavirus">FIFA</a> <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/youth-sports.html">CDC</a> , <a href="https://www.nj.gov/dcf/coronavirus.html">NJ Children and Families</a> and the <a href="https://nj.gov/health/cd/documents/topics/NCOV/COVID_GuidanceForSportsActivities.pdf">NJ Department of Health</a> as they relate to the continuing Coronavirus outbreak. Our concern will always be the health and safety of our players, coaches, referees and their families in and around the game of soccer. As of the writing of this, all league events will go forward as scheduled. Some guidance from the sport and health agencies listed above note that:</p>
<p>The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed. Everyday preventive actions should be taken, including:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.</li>
<li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
<li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.</li>
<li>Follow the CDC’s recommendations for using a facemask.</li>
<li>Face coverings may be required of spectators depending on local ordinances and guidelines. All spectators should bring their face covering to each game</li>
<li>Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms to help prevent the spread of the disease.</li>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li>
</ul>
  <p>Please take steps to ensure the safety of your players, coaches and families while also promoting sportsmanship after the match. Many suggestions have been put forth regarding alternatives to the high five or hand shake after a match; those include fist bump, elbows, waving, and foot taps. Or please feel free to use any other method of promoting sportsmanship after a match while still keeping player safety in mind.</p>
