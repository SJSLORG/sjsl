<h2>Coronavirus Update</h2>
<h3>April 4th, 2020</h3>
<p>SJSL hopes that everyone is staying safe and healthy during these challenging times.  It is important to take all of the recommended precautions seriously, to stay educated, and to protect ourselves and our families.  On the youth soccer front, we offer the following update.</p>
<p>SJSL held a virtual Executive Board meeting on April 2, 2020 and discussed options for the foreseeable future. As recently mandated by USSF and US Club Soccer, all SJSL matches are cancelled thru April 30th.  This includes all soccer matches, makeups, friendlies, practices, tryouts, tournaments and social gatherings.  While the outlook for league matches during May is not promising, we remain hopeful that some soccer may be played later this spring or early summer.  That decision, however, will depend upon the directives that we receive from the Governor of New Jersey, the CDC, US Soccer, and the various national agencies.  Safety remains our number one priority.</p> 
<p>The status of the current pandemic and the future of youth sports may change from day to day as we learn more.  We expect that US Club Soccer will release another statement sometime mid-April.  Please be assured that SJSL will not take any steps to resume play unless thoroughly approved and vetted by the appropriate medical and national soccer authorities.</p> 
<p>At this time, SJSL is proactively taking steps to address the viability of the upcoming GM meetings, board elections, the continuation of the spring season, and the fall registration dates.  Accordingly, please understand that the scheduled May 7th SJSL GM Meeting has been postponed and will be rescheduled at a future date.  We are reviewing our options to meet virtually since there is business that the league must conduct over the next 2 months. As well, the June 8th SJSL Annual GM Meeting is also on hold.  Once we have confirmed the new dates and new meeting arrangements, everyone will be notified.</p> 
<p>All updates will be sent out through our email portal in Got Soccer to all club reps (registered under "SJSL Boys" and SJSL Rep) and club presidents listed in Got Soccer, and the information will be posted on the league web site.  As the information becomes available, these updates will address, among other topics, the remaining status of the Spring season, the possibility of summer makeup games, the opportunity for refund credits, the new meeting dates and meeting procedures, the Fall registration period, and all upcoming important league dates.</p>  
<p>Please stay safe and healthy during these troubled times and until some normalcy resumes in all of our lives.</p>

<h3>March 23rd, 2020</h3>

<p>SJSL has been continuously monitoring the Covid-19 pandemic and the reports released from the US Soccer Federation, US Club Soccer, and the various national and state governmental agencies.  We are aware as well of the steps already taken by our member clubs, and associated local schools and towns.</p>

<p>As has been previously announced, many of our schools are closed until April 20th, and US Club Soccer has suspended all covered activities until at least April 12, 2020.  US Club has specifically suspended all activities by member organizations, including league and tournament play, scrimmages, practices, training and tryouts.</p>

<p>While we remain hopeful that some portion of the spring season may be played, given the current state of the pandemic and the unsure future, SJSL has determined the following at this point:</p>

<ol>
<li>All SJSL games originally scheduled for 3/15 and 3/22 and previously suspended, including any scheduled make up games, will not be made up.</li>
<li>All SJSL matches scheduled for 3/29 and 4/19 are now postponed, including any scheduled makeup games, and most likely will not be played.</li>
<li>No game reschedule requests or TBAs will be considered until further notice.</li>
<li>SJ Cup games will be addressed as we get closer to those dates.</li>
</ol>

<p>Another review and update will take place over the next couple of weeks with the hope that the pandemic takes a turn for the better over that time period.</p>

<p>We are in uncharted territory here.  There is always the possibility that the entire spring season may need to be cancelled.  Many factors will be considered in reaching that ultimate decision, as well as any rescheduling alternatives, if that decision becomes reality.  Safety will always be the foremost factor.  The priority right now is to protect our players and their families.</p>

<p>Please stay safe.  We encourage all of our members to stay educated on the precautions and proactive measures published by the CDC, WHO and NJ Department of Health.  Thank you for your support and understanding in this challenging time.  We will get through this together as a community and as a nation.</p>

  <p><strong>SOUTH JERSEY SOCCER LEAGUE</strong></p>

  <h3>March 12th, 2020</h3>
  <p>To everyone - having reviewed the recommendations from the US Soccer Federation and US Club Soccer, and in light of the concerns raised by our member clubs, the South Jersey Soccer League (Boys) has decided the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>All games for the month of March (3/15, 3/22, 3/29) are suspended, including any scheduled make up games.</li>
<li>We will reevaluate our position and email all member clubs on Wednesday, March 26th  regarding whether the games scheduled for 3/29 will remain suspended or will be played.</li>
<li>Round 2 games (3/15) will not be made up.</li>
<li>Round 3 games (3/22) will not be made up if the league also cancels Round 4 games (3/29), otherwise a decision on the round makeup will be made at a later date.</li>
<li>Matches played in violation of this policy will not be sanctioned by the league.</li>
</ol>

<p>We encourage all of our members to stay educated on the precautions and proactive measures published by the CDC, WHO and NJ Department of Health.  Player and family safety should be our first priority.  Thank you for your support and understanding in this challenging time.</p>

  <h3>March 7th, 2020</h3>
  <p> SJSL is working hard to stay up to date about the warnings and advice offered by the United States Soccer Federation, the CDC and other health organizations regarding the Coronavirus outbreak. Our concern is always with the health and safety of our players, coaches, referees and their families in and around the game of soccer. The guidance from <a href="http://view.email.ussoccer.com/?qs=92901566ac75650fa1c8ac4915e5161f7f96ab3372fef74c47a62a10222fe80951c9e8cd5c512ab3b1aa8cc2e59e5202bf9cb81b18790e12fbb27b7d4dca316dff9467b5484232d691eb3b92ad02f977" title="U.S. Soccer">US Soccer</a> notes that: </p>
  <p> The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed. Everyday preventive actions should be taken, including: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
    <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.</li>
    <li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
    <li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
    <li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.</li>
    <li>Follow the CDCâ€™s recommendations for using a facemask.</li>
    <li>CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including Coronavirus.</li>
    <li>Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms to help prevent the spread of the disease.</li>
    <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li>
    <li>If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> Several sports organizations have looked for and imposed alternatives to the pre and post game handshaking rituals. Proposed ideas have included: waving, fist bumping, elbow bumping, inside foot touches, among others. Please discuss these alternatives with your players and teams and feel free to utilize those ideas that you feel are both safer and continue to encourage sportsmanship among our players. </p>
  <p> Thank you, </p>
