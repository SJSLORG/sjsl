  <h2>Coronavirus Update</h2>
  <h3>March 12th, 2020<h3>
  <p>To everyone - having reviewed the recommendations from the US Soccer Federation and US Club Soccer, and in light of the concerns raised by our member clubs, the South Jersey Soccer League (Boys) has decided the following:</p>

1.  All games for the month of March (3/15, 3/22, 3/29) are suspended.
2.  We will reevaluate our position and email all member clubs on Wednesday, March 26th  regarding whether the games scheduled for 3/29 will remain suspended or will be played.
3.  Round 2 games (3/15) will not be made up.
4.  Round 3 games (3/22) will not be made up if the league also cancels Round 4 games (3/29), otherwise a decision on the round makeup will be made at a later date.
5.  Matches played in violation of this policy will not be sanctioned by the league.

<p>We encourage all of our members to stay educated on the precautions and proactive measures published by the CDC, WHO and NJ Department of Health.  Player and family safety should be our first priority.  Thank you for your support and understanding in this challenging time.</p>

  <h3>March 7th, 2020</h3>
  <p> SJSL is working hard to stay up to date about the warnings and advice offered by the United States Soccer Federation, the CDC and other health organizations regarding the Coronavirus outbreak. Our concern is always with the health and safety of our players, coaches, referees and their families in and around the game of soccer. The guidance from <a href="http://view.email.ussoccer.com/?qs=92901566ac75650fa1c8ac4915e5161f7f96ab3372fef74c47a62a10222fe80951c9e8cd5c512ab3b1aa8cc2e59e5202bf9cb81b18790e12fbb27b7d4dca316dff9467b5484232d691eb3b92ad02f977" title="U.S. Soccer">US Soccer</a> notes that: </p>
  <p> The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed. Everyday preventive actions should be taken, including: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
    <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.</li>
    <li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
    <li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
    <li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.</li>
    <li>Follow the CDCâ€™s recommendations for using a facemask.</li>
    <li>CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including Coronavirus.</li>
    <li>Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms to help prevent the spread of the disease.</li>
    <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li>
    <li>If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> Several sports organizations have looked for and imposed alternatives to the pre and post game handshaking rituals. Proposed ideas have included: waving, fist bumping, elbow bumping, inside foot touches, among others. Please discuss these alternatives with your players and teams and feel free to utilize those ideas that you feel are both safer and continue to encourage sportsmanship among our players. </p>
  <p> Thank you, </p>
