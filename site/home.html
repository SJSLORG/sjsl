  <h2>South Jersey Strong</h2>
  <h3>May 2nd, 2020</h3>
  <p>As we all continue to deal with Covid-19 and the challenges presented, SJSL hopes that everyone is remaining safe and healthy. This pandemic has forced all of us to adjust our lives in the name of safety for everyone. As this crisis continues, we will strive to keep everyone as updated as we can. We know that many of you are anxious to return to the field, but we must stress the continued need to conform with all applicable state and federal health guidelines and safety procedures. </p>
  <p>At this time, US Club Soccer has extended the suspension of all game related activity (practices, training, tryouts, friendlies, games, etc.) until May 18, 2020. *See Letter from Kevin Payne below. In addition, the State of New Jersey has restricted group gatherings and closed schools at least through May 15, 2020. While the Governor has eased the limitations on county and state parks, activities in those locations are limited to passive recreation. Team sports remain prohibited. Further announcements will be made by both organizations later in mid-May.</p>
  <p>As a result of these decisions, and in light of the concerns that many players and parents have expressed even if the state restrictions are eased, the SJSL Spring 2020 season has been cancelled. It is not practical at this point to attempt to extend and play the season through the summer. Assuming that US Club and the State of NJ allow play during the summer months, opportunities for friendlies to be played or used as tryouts will be up to each club. The league will offer its support once we are assured the restrictions by US Club and the State of NJ have been removed. </p>
  <p>The SJSL Executive Board met on 4/30 and the following was determined:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All Clubs who had teams registered for the Spring 2020 season will receive full credit ($80 per spring registered team) towards the Fall 2020 season. The clubs will each decide how to administer that credit within their club.</li>
    <li>Fall registration will open June 1st and will close on approximately July 15th. Additional time may be afforded to select teams if needed. How this will be handled, and additional dates and information will follow as we are apprised of guidelines imposed by US Club and the State of NJ.</li>
    <li>The registration fee for the SJSL Fall 2020 season will be $80 per team.</li>
    <li>Clubs will be emailed their Fall invoice which will include the credit from their spring registered teams.</li>
    <li>Any additional fees owed may be mailed in by August 1, 2020 to the SJSL Treasurer. The contact information will be included on the invoice. There will be NO meeting to make payments this year. More details will follow.</li>
    <li>Dates will be flexible depending on when the New Jersey restrictions are lifted.</li>
    <li>The start of the Fall season will be September 13th. (Labor Day is late this year)</li>
    <li>All of the above is conditioned on all restrictions being lifted as to gatherings by New Jersey and as sanctioned by US Club Soccer.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We know that you are frustrated. Stay strong! SJSL hopes everyone stays safe and healthy and looks forwarded to the return of SOCCER!!</p>
  <p><strong>SJSL Executive Board</strong></p>
  <p>* The following is the update from US Club:</p>
  <p>MEMBER UPDATE: </p>
  <p>Letter from Kevin Payne regarding COVID-19; extension of suspension until May 18</p>
  <p>April 27, 2020</p>
  <p>Dear members,</p>
  <p>As a number of states and local jurisdictions begin planning for a phased return to normalcy, US Club Soccer has targeted May 18th as the date we hope to return decision-making authority to our local leagues. This is subject to change, of course, but it is our hope that our members can begin to sensibly return to the fields after that, subject to some requirements and recommendations.</p>
  <p>The return-to-play decision is a complicated one. We understand just how important it is for clubs, coaches, parents and players to play organized soccer again. But, as parts of the country begin to open up over the coming weeks, we encourage everyone to exercise extreme caution and continue to abide by public health experts' guidelines for hygiene, physical distancing, facemask use, etc. You can read about those guidelines on this CDC web page.</p>
  <p>When play does resume in your area, we'll require compliance with safety measures that adhere to the CDC and federal and local governments. We will share a comprehensive list before returning to play.</p>
  <p>The federal guidelines for states to resume business activities are outlined on this federal "Opening America" web page. In this phased approach, "schools and organized youth activities" - including sporting venues - are listed in the second phase, which is applicable for states and regions with no evidence of a rebound and that satisfy all establishing criteria.</p>
  <p>We're hopeful that the continued suspension of activities until May 18th puts us in a position to begin Phase 2. We will continue to monitor the situation and follow up the week prior with a return-to-play decision.</p>
  <p>Stay strong and stay safe.</p></div><hr />
