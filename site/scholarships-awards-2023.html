            <p>My name is Justin Blaylock and I have been playing soccer since I was four years old. I have always had high grades with all A's as my end of the year grades throughout high school, and I will be graduating as the Valedictorian of Overbrook High School's class of 2023. In my soccer career I have bounced around a lot of teams either due to them folding or not enjoying the team or coaching staff. I had settled for a few years in Highland, Winslow, and Marlton with the latter being where I ended my career with a team I loved playing with, though of course not the only team I enjoyed, as Highland was a team I had made many friends on and so was my Winslow team. I am going to Wentworth Institute of Technology this coming year for computer engineering and hope to continue playing soccer there. I played for my school all four years that I was in high school and also played for the tennis team my last two years as well as having been in the NHS chapter at my school.</p></div>

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Colin Kirk:</span>University of
                Vermont</p>
            <p>My name is Colin Kirk and I am a senior at Haddon Heights High School. I competed in the
                South Jersey Soccer League with Berlin Borough Soccer Club from age seven all the way up
                until my senior year. In high school, I was a varsity player for three years and a captain during
                my senior year. In addition to soccer, I was a varsity tennis player for two years. Aside from
                athletics, I was also an active member in my community and an accomplished student. To help
                my community, I spearheaded a shoe drive in collaboration with the organization I regularly
                volunteer with, For the Love of Pete's Pantry NJ, which I called “Happy Feet on the Street.” The
                goal of this drive was to raise money and new/lightly used shoes for the less fortunate on the
                streets of Philadelphia. I was able to raise over $2000 and around 225 pairs of shoes. I was also
                a member of both the National Honor Society and the Garnet and Gold Club, which is a
                volunteering club at our school. I finished in the top 10% of my graduating class and was
                nominated for multiple academic awards. I plan to further my education at the University of
                Vermont, majoring in Wildlife and Fisheries Biology.</p></div>

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ryan Kozej:</span>Rowan University</p>
            <p>Hello, my name is Ryan Kozej and I want to start by saying thank you to the South Jersey Soccer League Board, Scholarship Committee and the membership for choosing me as a recipient for one of it’s scholarships. I am truly honored and humbled to have been selected.
                I have been playing in the South Jersey Soccer League since my U7 year with the Washington Township Soccer Club and finishing my senior year at Deptford Soccer. Also, I have been a USSF grassroots referee for the last four years, officiating games in both South Jersey leagues and EDP. While my youth soccer playing days have come to an end, I intend to stay involved with the game by continuing to referee on weekends. I am a senior at Washington Township High School where I will graduate this month with honors finishing with a 99 GPA. During high school, I was part of the STEM Academy program, French Club, Interact Club, Math Club, the Renaissance Club and was part of the WTHS Boys Golf Team my freshman and sophomore years. In addition to these, I was also member of the National Honors Society, Mu Alpha Theta (Math Honors Society), Société Honoraire de Franҫais (French Honors Society), Science Honors Society, and the English Honors Society. Through these clubs and honors societies, I was able to participate in numerous philanthropic activities throughout my high school years giving back to the
                community and the less fortunate. Upon graduation, I will be attending Rowan University in Glassboro, NJ majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in French. During college, I would like to study abroad for a year in France as well. Thank you again for selecting me as one of the SJSL Scholarship winners for 2023</p></div>
